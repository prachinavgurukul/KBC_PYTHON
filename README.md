# KBC_PYTHON
I made KBC(Kon-Bnega-Crorpati)using loop list and conditional statement.
For this firstly I create a new file.
In the file I write my KBC code.
Firstly I added question_list.
Also added options_list,life_line_50_50 list and also give key solution in the solution list.
and we take first prize 10 thousand and here I use first while loop which is applied on question_list if condition is true it will furter process
and I applied second loop on option_list after then I used conditional statement if condition is true then it will ask Do you want life line? and if user
says yes then it will give life_line_50_50 only for one time because we use life_line only once, if answer is correct then user won the game with 10thousand if user give correct answers continuously then it 
increse his/her price by adding 10 thousand per time and says ("Congratulation!You are winner with priceðŸ¥³",b),here b is the value of prize,but if user give incorrect answers
then it says "Koi nhi beta next time try krnaðŸ˜Š".
